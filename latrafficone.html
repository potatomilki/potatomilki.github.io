<h1 style="text-align: center;">the story of <strong>hatha nthr rack? "traffic"</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">back in 2012 i was playing minecraft on a world i created,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">my brother was on the couch ontop of me, and i was on the bottom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/799979639904141324/799984434656313384/unknown.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">my brother was watching football on tv waiting for food,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">then the commentator said that there was alot of traffic and the</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">football match was delayed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">my brother was bored and looked at my screen,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">he told me راكان هذا نذر راك؟ (rakan is that nether rack?) hence the name</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"hatha nthr rack" which is arabic for what i said,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">i said that it was snow because you were looking from up there,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">and he stepped down and noticed it was inverted from the couch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">take this with a grain of salt because</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">apart of this might be incorrect because of my memory.</p>
