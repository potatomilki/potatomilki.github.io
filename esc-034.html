<p style="text-align: center;">ESC-034 &ldquo;Quarter of Dimensions&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Object Class (X-Safe)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Description:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It&rsquo;s a quarter with no heads or tails and its located anywhere in the facility, actually anywhere it wants to be, for some reason when anyone picks it up it changes location and time it appears randomly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Special Containment Procedures:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It&rsquo;s put on a facility on x-light containment zone of site 420, it serves no purpose but teleporting everywhere so we just put it with a level 1 access card because it&rsquo;s TOO safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Origins:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was found randomly in Belgium in 19██ it was picked up then it disappeared to where it is to this day.</p>
